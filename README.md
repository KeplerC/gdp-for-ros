### Important Note

It's still a proof of concept implementation that is not planned to be used by anyone. A few links that might be helpful:

* [Our Workshop arxiv] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11691)



### What the code does: 


### Setup Env
Install ROS2 properly by [link](
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
and create a local ROS workspace.
```
mkdir -p ~/fog_ws/src
cd ~/fog_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:KeplerC/gdp-for-ros.git
cd ../
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Install pythons depenencies by
```
pip3 install PyDispatcher scapy
```

### To run 

Step 1: import the ROS env 
```
cd ~/fog_ws
source install/setup.bash
```
This needs to be done on every new terminals.

Step 2: build
```
colcon build
```
Whenever there is code changes, a new build is required.

Step 3: Run
First start the pseudo gdp infrastructure by 
```
python3 fake_gdp_infrastructure.py
```
then run the sample talker and listener by
```
ros2 run gdp_proxy_for_ros talker
```
and
```
 ros2 run gdp_proxy_for_ros listener
```
The talker publishes to the topic named `topic` and the listener subscribes to `/gdp/topic`. 

Then run
```
ros2 run gdp_proxy_for_ros proxy
```
that bridges the `topic` and `gdp/topic` together. The messages in `topic` are serialized and propaged through `fake_gdp_infrastructure.py` implemented by zmq. (TODO:Jiachen, replace with the real router). 

### Note

1. The code adopts the code from draft PR from https://github.com/uos/rospy_message_converter/pull/56/, because ROS2 lacks message serialization schemes. 
2. several convienient commands 
```
colcon build && ros2 run gdp_proxy_for_ros proxy
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /gdp/topic
ros2 topic info /topic
```
